# Molecule-Graph-Prediction

## Abstract
In this project, GNN has been introduced with self-attention mechanism to solve drug candidate screening problems. Specifically, the model is trained to predict whether a drug molecule can inhibit HIV replication or not. As a result, this model has showed the same performance with a smaller number of parameters. 

## Dataset
The dataset consists of each molecule information and whether the molecule inhibits HIV replication or not. (Binary Classification problem) The name of the dataset is ogbg-molhiv.
